"My boy, Chris, is rocking it as a programmer at QSM. I kicked off his journey early, teaching him the ropes of Mastercam programming when he was just 13. When he hit the big 1-5, Chuck saw his talent and brought him on board as a CNC wizard.

Fast-forward to now, Chris is a cool twenty-year-old pulling in a solid $30 an hour â€“ proud dad moment, right there. ðŸš€

As for me, I did the Blue Origin thing for a couple of years, but something didn't quite click. Even though I was all in as a mill-turn guru, and I was crunching numbers on million-dollar parts, the paycheck didn't quite match the game.

See, Blue Origin's got the whole company-with-a-machine-shop deal going on. I've found my groove in places where the machine shop is the heart and soul of the operation. Just feels right, you know?" ðŸ˜ŽðŸ”§
