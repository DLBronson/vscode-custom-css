"Hey 

Thanks a bunch for those catalogs! Unfortunately, I hit a little snag – I can't save them to the right directory without administrator approval. 🙁

I even tried the ol' 'save to my desktop and then copy-paste' trick, but no dice. Then, my trusty method of firing up PowerShell as an admin and navigating to the folder failed me too. Strange one, isn't it?" 😅🖥️📁
