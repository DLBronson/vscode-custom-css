"Hey Matt,

I'm John B, the new NC programmer on the block. Just a quick heads up, I put in a request with IT to get the green light for VSCode and Python, but it's been a bit quiet on their end.

Now, here's the twistâ€”I heard through the grapevine that you might already have these apps. If that's the case, it's gotta mean they're ITAR compliant, right?

Catch you later,
John" ðŸ˜Ž
