"Creating programs for the market, that's on a whole different level! Personally, I've never tackled anything quite that massive. If I did, I'd probably apologize in advance to anyone using it without their trusty fly swatter â€“ it'd be a bug party for sure, lol.

But you know what, there's this one thing I'm pretty proud of. I once got paid by my old company to whip up a system that could mine all that MBD data from Catpart and Catproduct files. Then, I'd spin it all into these super user-friendly PDF docs with part notes, screen grabs, and even slick 3D representations of the parts. That was pretty rad!" ðŸ˜ŽðŸš€
