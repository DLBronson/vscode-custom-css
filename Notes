Subject: Request to Dive Into Programming Assignments

Dear [Manager's Name],

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to express my eagerness and readiness to dive into programming assignments right away. Rather than going through additional training, I believe I can learn and contribute more effectively by taking on real-world tasks.

I have been diligently studying and preparing myself for this transition, and I feel confident in my ability to handle the responsibilities associated with programming parts. I'm excited about the opportunity to apply my skills and make a meaningful impact on our projects.

If you're willing to assign me my first part to program, I am enthusiastic about proving myself and contributing to our team's success. I'm open to any guidance or support you may have for me as I take on this challenge.

Thank you for considering my request, and I look forward to your guidance as I take this next step in my role.

Best regards,

[Your Name]
