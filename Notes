"Hey Ben, it's John B. We crossed paths that one time in your programming den.

So, word on the street is you've got that killer Nova rocking a 502 big block. Is that for real or just some ruler talk?

Well, Ben, if the rumor's true and you're up for a spin, count me in anytime. That sounds like an amazing ride, and I can't wait to see it someday, hopefully!" 😎🚗💨🤟
