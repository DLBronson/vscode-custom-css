"Hey Derek,

Great to hear you're doing well! ðŸ˜Ž

So, during the whole COVID saga, I was grinding it out at QSM, putting in those record hours, and even snagged a bonus for two straight years of perfect attendance through the COVID chaos. But eventually, I decided it was time to move on.

Once I had my son up to speed as a CNC programmer there, I took my exit. Chuck and I worked out the plan, and he gave me the green light to take a few months off before I kickstart my gig at Blue Origin. Time for a breather, you know?" ðŸš€
