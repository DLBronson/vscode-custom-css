Subject: Ready to Dive into Programming!

Hey [Manager's Name],

Hope you're doing well! I've been thinking, and I'm super pumped to start programming parts. Instead of more training, I'm eager to jump in and learn by doing.

I've been prepping for this and feel confident about taking on real projects. If you're up for it, I'd love to tackle my first programming assignment. I'm all in and ready to prove myself!

If you have any tips or guidance, I'm all ears. Let's make some cool stuff happen!

Cheers,

[Your Name]
