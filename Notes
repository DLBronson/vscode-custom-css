Subject: Request for Installation of Visual Studio Code and Python

Dear IT Department,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to request the installation of Microsoft Visual Studio Code and Python on my work computer. These tools are essential for my work, and I believe they will significantly enhance my productivity.

However, I would like to bring to your attention that I am unsure whether Microsoft Visual Studio Code and Python are ITAR (International Traffic in Arms Regulations) compliant. I had these tools installed on my work computer at Blue Origin, my previous place of employment, without any compliance issues. Still, I understand that our organization may have different regulations and policies in place.

I kindly request that you review the compliance status of Visual Studio Code and Python for our organization. If there are any concerns or restrictions regarding their installation, please let me know so that we can explore alternative solutions or seek necessary approvals.

I greatly appreciate your assistance in this matter. These tools are crucial for my work, and I believe they will contribute to the efficiency and success of our projects. If you require any additional information or have questions, please do not hesitate to reach out to me.

Thank you for your attention to this request.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
