"Sure thing!

I'm a big fan of VSCode; it's my go-to text editor. I use it for everything from editing text documents to taking notes in markdown, and even for script and program debugging in a variety of languages like G-code, Python, batch, HTML, and VBS.

Python is another one of my go-to tools. I use it for tasks like searching for patterns in G-code files, setting up folder structures for the parts I program, taking screen captures in Vericut, and creating CNC setup documentation. Occasionally, I also use it for scraping online Catia help pages to put together notes and how-to documents."
