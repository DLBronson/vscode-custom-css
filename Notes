"Dear Sir,

I apologize for the delay in responding to your inquiry about the 'copy and paste' application installed on my system.

This program facilitates a convenient way to copy either the file name or its path by simply right-clicking, without including quotation marks around the string. For instance, I can easily paste the path to a file directly into a 'Run' window or an Explorer address bar, enabling immediate navigation to the desired location without the need to manually remove quotation marks.

Should you have any further queries or require additional information, please feel free to reach out, and I will respond promptly.

Sincerely,"
