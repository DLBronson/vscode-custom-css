Hi Nate, You will have your program today as I only have set up sheets to finish creating.

The program for this part is like a snowball. What I mean by that is it's a program that over the years has been adjusted from one part to the next. An accumulating
Which left the master cam file full of redundant and or unnecessary toolpath, cutters and worst of all, unnecessary origins

I decided to reprogram the part I'm just trying to send a message I'm sorry

The program now uses a single centralized origin which makes the 
setup much faster for the machinist and gives them a single origin 
to manage rather than six different origins with some of those origins almost impossible to pick u
I feel this type of setup removes uncertainty and replaces it with
Something the programmer and machine is can trust. A single source for all dimensions that's easy 
The machinist to find
